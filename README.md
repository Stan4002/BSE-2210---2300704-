## Student Management System

# Overview
This is a simple Python-based Student Management System designed to manage student records in a database. Users can perform tasks like adding students, deleting students, updating their information, and viewing all students. The system has been refactored to follow key software design principles like SOLID, DRY, KISS, and YAGNI.

## Features

- Add new students to the system.
- Delete students based on their ID.
- Update student information (name, age, major).
- View all students currently in the system.
- Verify whether a student exists before making updates or deletions.
